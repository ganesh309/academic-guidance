# Pre-deploy command to migrate and seed database
# Note: Render doesn't natively support "pre-deploy" hooks in render.yaml for Docker runtime easily without a start script.
# We will use the Dockerfile CMD or a custom entrypoint script to handle this if needed, 
# but for now we expect the user to run migrations manually or we can add it to the start command.
# For simplicity in this Blueprint, we will rely on a post-deploy manual step or embedding it in the container startup logic.
# However, usually adding it to the start command is best:
# command: sh -c "php artisan migrate --force --seed && /usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf"
